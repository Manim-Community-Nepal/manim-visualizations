    "# 📖 What is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** is a method of breaking down *any* matrix into a product of three simpler, more fundamental matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a matrix $A$ as a \"transformation machine.\" You put a vector (a point in space) $\\vec{x}$ into it, and it gives you a new vector $\\vec{y}$ out: $A\\vec{x} = \\vec{y}$. This transformation can be complex: it might stretch, squash, rotate, and shear all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD tells us that this complex machine, $A$, is *secretly* just a simple three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: A Rotation** (or reflection).\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: A Scaling** (stretching or squashing along the new rotated axes).\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Another Rotation** (or reflection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD \"recipe\" is written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$A$** is your original $m \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "* **$U$** is the $m \\times m$ matrix for the final rotation.\n",
    "* **$\\Sigma$** (Sigma) is the $m \\times n$ matrix for the scaling.\n",
    "* **$V^T$** is the $n \\times n$ matrix for the initial rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly understand this, we must first understand the \"ingredients\": $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🥣 Part 1: The \"Ingredients\" Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the simple concepts that SVD is built from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix\n",
    "A matrix is a grid of numbers that acts as a transformation machine.\n",
    "* **Example:** $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "    If you put the vector $\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (a point at x=1, y=0) into it, you get:\n",
    "    $A\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "    The matrix $A$ moved the point $(1, 0)$ to $(2, 1)$. This is a stretch and a shear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Transpose ($A^T$)\n",
    "The transpose \"flips\" a matrix along its main diagonal. Rows become columns, and columns become rows.\n",
    "* **Example:** If $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. (This matrix is *symmetric*).\n",
    "* **Example 2:** If $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $B^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagonal Matrix\n",
    "A matrix where all entries are zero *except* for the values on the main diagonal. Its only job is to **scale** (stretch or squash) space along the standard axes (the x-axis, y-axis, etc.).\n",
    "* **Example:** $D = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "    This matrix transforms a vector $\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$ into $\\begin{bmatrix} 3x \\\\ 0.5y \\end{bmatrix}$. It stretches space by 3x along the x-axis and squashes it by 0.5x along the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orthogonal Matrix ($Q$)\n",
    "This is the most important ingredient. It represents a **pure rotation or reflection**.\n",
    "* **Geometric Property:** It **preserves lengths and angles**.\n",
    "    * If you take a vector $\\vec{x}$, its length *does not change* when you transform it with $Q$.\n",
    "    * If you take two perpendicular vectors, $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$, their transformed versions ($Q\\vec{x}$ and $Q\\vec{y}$) will *still be perpendicular*.\n",
    "* **Mathematical Property:** Its columns are **orthonormal**.\n",
    "    * *Ortho-* (Orthogonal): Each column vector is perpendicular (at a 90° angle) to every other column vector.\n",
    "    * *-normal* (Normalized): Each column vector has a length of 1.\n",
    "* **The Key Test:** A matrix $Q$ is orthogonal if its transpose is also its inverse.\n",
    "    > $Q^T Q = I$ (the identity matrix)\n",
    "    This means \"undoing\" the rotation ($Q^{-1}$) is as simple as \"flipping\" it ($Q^T$).\n",
    "* **Example:** $Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "    This is a 90° counter-clockwise rotation. Let's test it on $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (the x-axis vector):\n",
    "    $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ (the y-axis vector).\n",
    "    It rotated the x-axis to the y-axis, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🍳 Part 2: The \"Recipe\" - Deconstructing $A = U \\Sigma V^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the three parts of the SVD formula. Remember our story: **Rotate 1, then Scale, then Rotate 2.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. $V^T$: The First Rotation (The \"Input Aligner\")\n",
    "* **What it is:** $V^T$ is an $n \\times n$ **orthogonal matrix**.\n",
    "* **What it does:** It takes your input vector and **rotates** it.\n",
    "* **Why?** It rotates the input space so that its *most important directions* are perfectly aligned with the standard axes (x, y, z...). These \"most important directions\" are called the **Right Singular Vectors**, and they are the columns of $V$ (the rows of $V^T$).\n",
    "* **Analogy:** Imagine your transformation $A$ is a pasta machine that squashes dough flat. $V^T$ is the first step: *rotating the ball of dough* so it's aligned with the machine's rollers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. $\\Sigma$: The Scaling (The \"Stretching & Squashing\")\n",
    "* **What it is:** $\\Sigma$ is an $m \\times n$ **diagonal matrix**.\n",
    "* **What it does:** It scales the rotated vector along each axis. The diagonal entries are the **Singular Values** ($\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, ...$).\n",
    "* **Key Details:**\n",
    "    * These values are always positive ($\\ge 0$).\n",
    "    * They are sorted by \"importance\": $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3 \\ge ...$\n",
    "    * $\\sigma_1$ is the \"most important\" scaling factor, and $\\sigma_2$ is the second most, and so on.\n",
    "* **Analogy:** This *is* the pasta machine's rollers. It squashes the dough (vector) along the 2nd axis (e.g., $\\sigma_2 = 0.1$) and stretches it along the 1st axis (e.g., $\\sigma_1 = 4$). If a singular value is 0, it means that direction is *completely flattened*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. $U$: The Second Rotation (The \"Output Aligner\")\n",
    "* **What it is:** $U$ is an $m \\times m$ **orthogonal matrix**.\n",
    "* **What it does:** It takes the stretched-and-squashed vector and **rotates** it to its final position in the output space.\n",
    "* **Why?** The scaling step left our vector aligned with the axes. $U$ rotates it to whatever final orientation the original matrix $A$ required. The columns of $U$ are called the **Left Singular Vectors** and they form the new, principal axes of the *output*.\n",
    "* **Analogy:** The flattened pasta comes out of the machine. $U$ is the step where you *rotate* the sheet of pasta to place it on the drying rack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎨 Part 3: The Geometric Picture (Circle to Ellipse)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most powerful way to understand SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imagine transforming a unit circle** (all 2D vectors with length 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start:** We have a unit circle. Its main axes are the x-axis $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and y-axis $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "2.  **Apply $V^T$ (Rotate 1):** $V^T$ rotates the circle. It's still a perfect circle. But its axes are now aligned with the new **right singular vectors** ($v_1, v_2$).\n",
    "3.  **Apply $\\Sigma$ (Scale):** $\\Sigma$ scales this rotated circle. It stretches by $\\sigma_1$ along the $v_1$ axis and by $\\sigma_2$ along the $v_2$ axis. This transforms the circle into an **ellipse**. The lengths of the ellipse's main axes are exactly $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$.\n",
    "4.  **Apply $U$ (Rotate 2):** $U$ takes this new ellipse (which is currently aligned with $v_1, v_2$) and **rotates** it into its final position. The final axes of the ellipse point along the **left singular vectors** ($u_1, u_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVD, in essence, finds the directions in your input space ($V$) that map perfectly to perpendicular directions in your output space ($U$), and tells you how much each direction was stretched or squashed ($\\Sigma$).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Part 4: Key Properties & Why SVD is So Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD isn't just a mathematical curiosity; its properties are the reason it's used in data science, image compression, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Relation to Eigenvalues (The \"Proof\" of SVD)\n",
    "This property shows *how* we find $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V$.\n",
    "* **Property:** The squares of the singular values ($\\sigma_i^2$) are the **eigenvalues** of the matrix $A^T A$. The columns of $V$ are the **eigenvectors** of $A^T A$.\n",
    "* **Proof Sketch:**\n",
    "    $A = U \\Sigma V^T$\n",
    "    $A^T = (U \\Sigma V^T)^T = V \\Sigma^T U^T$\n",
    "    Let's compute $A^T A$:\n",
    "    $A^T A = (V \\Sigma^T U^T) (U \\Sigma V^T)$\n",
    "    Since $U$ is orthogonal, $U^T U = I$ (the identity matrix), so they cancel out:\n",
    "    $A^T A = V (\\Sigma^T \\Sigma) V^T$\n",
    "    $\\Sigma^T \\Sigma$ is just a square diagonal matrix with $\\sigma_i^2$ on its diagonal. Let's call it $D$.\n",
    "    $A^T A = V D V^T$\n",
    "    This is the *definition* of eigendecomposition. It proves that **$V$ is the matrix of eigenvectors for $A^T A$** and **$D$ is the matrix of its eigenvalues (which are $\\sigma_i^2$)**.\n",
    "    *(A similar proof shows $U$ is the matrix of eigenvectors for $A A^T$)*.\n",
    "* **Example:** If $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $A^T A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\n",
    "    This means our singular values are $\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{0} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Rank\n",
    "* **Property:** The **rank** of a matrix $A$ (the number of independent dimensions it outputs) is equal to the number of **non-zero singular values**.\n",
    "* **Intuition:** The singular values are the \"magnitudes\" of the transformation's actions. If a singular value is 0, it means the machine *completely flattens* that direction. The rank is the count of directions that *survive* this flattening.\n",
    "* **Example:** For $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, our singular values were $\\sqrt{2}$ and $0$. We have **one** non-zero singular value, so the rank is **1**. This makes sense: the matrix $A$ transforms *every* 2D point onto the x-axis, which is a 1D line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Determinant\n",
    "* **Property:** For a square matrix $A$, the absolute value of its determinant is the product of all its singular values: $|\\det(A)| = \\sigma_1 \\cdot \\sigma_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot \\sigma_n$.\n",
    "* **Intuition:** The determinant measures how much a transformation changes *volume* (or area in 2D). The rotations $U$ and $V^T$ don't change volume ($\\det = \\pm 1$). The scaling matrix $\\Sigma$ *is* the change in volume. The new volume is just the product of the scaling factors in each direction ($\\sigma_1 \\times \\sigma_2 \\times ...$).\n",
    "* **Example:** For $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\det(A) = (1)(0) - (1)(0) = 0$. The singular values are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $0$. Their product is $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 0 = 0$. It matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Low-Rank Approximation (The \"Magic\" Property)\n",
    "* **Property:** The \"best\" rank-$k$ approximation of $A$ is found by taking its SVD and setting all but the largest $k$ singular values to zero.\n",
    "* **The Math:** $A$ can also be written as a sum:\n",
    "    $A = \\sigma_1 u_1 v_1^T + \\sigma_2 u_2 v_2^T + \\sigma_3 u_3 v_3^T + ...$\n",
    "    Since $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge ...$, the first term is the *most important part* of the matrix, the second term is the next most important, and so on.\n",
    "* **Approximation:** To get a \"good enough\" approximation of $A$, you just add up the first $k$ terms:\n",
    "    $A_k = \\sigma_1 u_1 v_1^T + ... + \\sigma_k u_k v_k^T$\n",
    "* **Application (Image Compression):** An image is just a matrix of pixel values. You compute its SVD. You might find it has 500 singular values. By keeping only the first 50 (the $k=50$ approximation), you can store just those 50 $\\sigma$'s and their corresponding $u, v$ vectors. This uses *far* less data, but the reconstructed image $A_{50}$ looks almost identical to the original. You've thrown away the \"noise\" and \"tiny details\" (the small singular values) and kept the \"important structure.\"\n",
    "\n",
